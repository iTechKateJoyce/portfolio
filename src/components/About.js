      <h1>Hi, I'm Kate ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p>A junior developer based in London with a background delivering events and brand experiences. </p>
      <p>My interest in coding began after feeling the impact of a custom application on my teamâ€™s day to day. It amazed me how one piece of software created so much positive change by easing pain points and boosting efficiency. </p>
      <p>I hope to provide the same value for future clients using a blend of technical and soft skills to deliver solutions that count. Iâ€™d love to work in a collaborative team where I can learn from others, add value and contribute to exciting projects.</p>
