        <br />
        <p>Dreamland is a full stack MERN app built with Python, React JS, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow interacting with a PostgreSQL database. It was created for attendees and event staff to use onsite across the live days of the event. Due to the presumed use case we decided on a mobile first design. Attendees can view the festival line up, create their personal schedule and place bar orders whilst event staff can view incoming orders and update collection status. </p>
